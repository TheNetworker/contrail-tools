The Basic flow of the code to generate the virtualizaed infrastructure is:

-> We have a input.json file in which we specify all the infrastructure details like, number of servers, number of networks, specific ip addresses to the inetrfaces of the servers.
-> We start the task by runnig the build_infra.sh file which takes in 2 arguments. (1) is the unique project name and (2) is the OS name for the VMs.
-> The build_infra.sh file first creates a new openstack project and generates the dashed format of that project UUID.
-> According to the second parameter to the build_infra.sh file, we will check if that OS image is added to openstack, if yes we go ahead. If no, we first download the image locally and 
   add to openstack.
-> We will attach this UUID to heat stack names and network names of that they dont interfere with each other if they run in parallel on the same cluster.
-> We then create 'network.yaml' and 'server.yaml' file so and then these file are used for launchng the heat stacks. We launch the network stack first and then the server stack.
-> With all the servers we will also launch a VM that will work as the server-manager.
-> After the stacks are created, we create various files that are important for our sanity to run. Namely, cluster.json & server.json that will be used for server-manager provisioning.
-> The server-manager-file and the config-node-ip files contain the floating ip address of the SM and the one of the config nodes so that it can be used by the jenkins job for automation.
-> We will also create the testbed.py file that will be imp for contrail-test to run properly.

-> All theses file: server.json, cluster.json, testbed.py will be created with combination of inputs. One of the inputs in the stacks that were created and the other major input is the input.json file that
   contains the parameters that need to go in thses file.
